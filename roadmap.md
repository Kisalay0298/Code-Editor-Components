# Online Code Editor - Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
The **Online Code Editor** is a web-based platform that allows users to write, edit, and execute code in multiple programming languages in real-time. It provides a seamless coding experience with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and instant execution.

## 2. Features
### a) **Core Features**
- **Multi-language Support**: Execute code in languages like C++, Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.
- **Real-time Execution**: Run code instantly and display output.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Improve readability with proper code formatting.
- **Auto-completion**: Suggest functions and keywords for efficiency.
- **Code Formatting**: Beautify code automatically.

### b) **User Features**
- **Authentication & Authorization**: User login/sign-up for personalized experience.
- **Save & Load Code**: Users can save their code snippets and access them later.
- **Code Sharing**: Share code with a unique URL.
- **Dark & Light Theme**: Toggle between different themes for better visibility.

### c) **Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)**
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the same file.
- **AI Code Suggestions**: Intelligent suggestions based on previous code.
- **Version Control**: Track changes and revert to previous versions.
- **Integration with GitHub**: Push and pull code from GitHub repositories.

## 3. Technology Stack
### **Frontend (User Interface)**
- **Framework**: React.js
- **State Management**: Context API / Redux (if needed)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / Styled Components
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor / CodeMirror

### **Backend (Server & Logic)**
- **Server Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Code Execution Engine**: Docker / Judge0 API / Custom Sandbox Environment
- **Database**: MySQL / MongoDB (for user code storage)
- **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth

### **Deployment**
- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel / Netlify
- **Backend Hosting**: AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean / Render
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas / AWS RDS / PlanetScale

## 4. System Architecture
### **1. User Interaction**
- Users interact via the frontend UI.
- Requests are sent to the backend for execution and storage.

### **2. Backend Processing**
- Code is received, sanitized, and sent to the execution engine.
- Output or errors are captured and returned.

### **3. Database Management**
- Usersâ€™ saved code is stored in the database.
- Metadata like execution history, timestamps, and user preferences are managed.

## 5. Development Roadmap
### **Phase 1 - MVP Development (2-3 Weeks)**
- âœ… Setup project structure (Frontend & Backend)
- âœ… Implement basic code execution for a single language
- âœ… Integrate a code editor (Monaco / CodeMirror)
- âœ… Add syntax highlighting and basic UI improvements

### **Phase 2 - Feature Expansion (4-6 Weeks)**
- âœ… Multi-language support
- âœ… User authentication (Sign up/Login)
- âœ… Save and Load functionality for user code
- âœ… Basic UI/UX improvements

### **Phase 3 - Advanced Features (6+ Weeks)**
- âœ… Code sharing via unique URLs
- âœ… Real-time collaboration (Socket.io/WebRTC)
- âœ… Version control & GitHub integration
- âœ… AI-based code suggestions

## 6. Challenges & Mitigation
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Secure code execution | Use containerized environments (Docker) or external execution APIs |
| Performance optimization | Optimize database queries, use caching (Redis) |
| UI responsiveness | Implement a mobile-friendly layout with Tailwind CSS |
| Scalability | Deploy using cloud services (AWS, DigitalOcean) and load balancing |

## 7. Conclusion
This **Online Code Editor** aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly coding experience. With a structured roadmap, strong architecture, and modern technology stack, it will cater to developers, students, and coding enthusiasts. ðŸš€
